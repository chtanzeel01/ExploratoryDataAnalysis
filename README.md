# Exploratory Data Analysis Of US Accidents
In my project centered on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the US accidents dataset, I delved into uncovering insightful patterns and trends within the vast dataset. 
Employing a variety of statistical and graphical tools, I sought to answer specific questions by creating informative visualizations. 
The exploration involved plotting graphs and charts to analyze factors such as the distribution of accidents across different regions and times, the correlation between weather conditions and accident severity, and the influence of various variables on accident rates. 
Through this EDA process, I not only gained a deeper understanding of the dataset but also derived valuable insights that contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of accidents on US roads.
